# Chapter 2 — The Rules That Implement the Split

Chapter 1 assigned the three vertices to two assets. This chapter writes
that split as frozen rules. The claim is still architectural: the protocol
fixes a **transform**, not a price and not a participation rate.

```
PoW discovers and orders
        ↓
ORU enters circulation (coinbase, 128 per block)
        ↓
ORU is destroyed (OP_CONVERGE)
        ↓
the same body transaction MAY mint RES
```

Proof-of-work discovers blocks and gives irreversible height order. It
**does not** create RES. No Convergence → no new RES.

---

## 2.1 One mechanism, not two isolated tickers

For Chapter 1’s triangle to hold, the two assets must be tied by a
one-way transform. Free convertibility would re-merge them into one
asset. No coupling at all would again detach the miner budget from the
scarce stock.

The protocol admits only this path:

```
work → ORU
ORU destroy → (may) RES
RES → ORU    illegal
```

`destroy_cost(h)` is a protocol destroy requirement, not a market quote.
While minting is open, a secondary RES/ORU ratio above that requirement
is bounded by mint arbitrage; a ratio below it simply stops minting. The
protocol does not publish a quote. It publishes the destroy cost at the
confirming height.

| Role | Asset | Frozen job |
|------|-------|------------|
| Medium of exchange, fees, miner cash-flow | **ORU** | Circulate; permanent subsidy; sole Convergence input |
| Store of value | **RES** | Finite stock; created only by destroying ORU; never reverse-converted |

Users **mine ORU**. Users **destroy ORU**. The same transaction **may**
mint RES. That sentence must not be shortened to “mine RES”.

---

## 2.2 ORU — rules for the flow

ORU carries the vertex that must be paid forever: the miner budget. It
is also the everyday medium of exchange. Issuance must therefore be
predictable, must not halve to zero, and must not carry a declared hard
cap — a cap would lock the store-of-value story back onto the flow
asset.

```
subsidy(0) = 0
subsidy(h) = 128 ORU          for every h ≥ 1
```

| Item | Frozen rule | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Script path | Witness v0 | Classification is identity, not a registry |
| Unit | `1 ORU = 100 000 000` atoms | Same decimals as RES; integer arithmetic |
| Genesis subsidy | `0` | Height 0 pays no subsidy |
| Every later block | `128 = 2⁷` ORU | Protocol floor for miner payment, independent of RES demand and of fees |
| Halving | None | Halving hands security back to the hope that fees appear |
| Declared cap | None | Hardness must be endogenous in `ρ`, not a number written at genesis |

Supply law:

```
S_ORU(h+1) = S_ORU(h) + R(h+1) − C(h+1)
```

`R(h)` is that block’s subsidy. `C(h)` is that block’s Convergence
destroy. Destroyed ORU leaves circulation. It does not become RES 1:1.

The inflation **rate** decays as `1/t`: about 1.00% at year 100, 0.100%
at year 1 000, monotonically toward zero and never reaching it. Residual
inflation **level** is not a schedule. It is `1 − ρ`. Under `ρ = 100%` —
every newly emitted ORU destroyed for RES — circulating ORU is exactly
constant. No fixed cap can express that. That is why ORU does not get
one.

Minimum destroy: a positive atom (`nValue > 0`) is a legal plain
destroy. The destroy that mints one RES atom at genesis is 1 024 ORU
atoms.

ORU is meant to move. Spending it is not spending the scarce stock.

---

## 2.3 RES — rules for the stock

RES carries the vertex that must remain scarce. It is therefore not
mined, not issued by governance, not swapped 1:1 for ORU, and not
convertible back. It is born only in a body transaction that destroys
ORU and mints Witness v1 RES in the same transaction.

Consensus never evaluates the display formula. It evaluates the same
relation with the division cleared:

```
R > 0  →  R · (2²⁵ + h)² ≤ B << 40
R = 0  →  B unconstrained              a plain destroy stays legal
```

`R` is RES atoms minted, `B` is the ORU atoms in the single
`OP_CONVERGE` output, `h` is the confirming height. Display form:

```
destroy_cost(h) = 1024 · (2²⁵ + h)² / 2⁵⁰
destroy_cost(0) = 1024 ORU per whole RES
```

`R = 0` is a legal plain destroy: ORU is removed and no RES is minted.
When `R > 0`, a failing inequality invalidates the whole transaction.

| Item | Frozen rule | Why |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Script path | Witness v1 | Isolated from ORU classification |
| Unit | `1 RES = 100 000 000` atoms | Aligned with ORU |
| Birth | Body-tx destroy-to-mint; never coinbase | Mining pays the flow, not the stock |
| Receiver | The transaction’s RES outputs, **not** the miner | Miners sell order and security; they do not pre-issue the reserve |
| Premine / admin mint | None | Entry must be a verifiable ORU destroy |
| Reverse conversion | Illegal | Otherwise the two assets re-merge |
| Per-block mint cap | None | Demand should be absorbable in a single block |
| Mint maturity | 100 blocks | Reorg protection, not a draw wait |
| Ceiling | `2²² = 4 194 304` RES | Derived; see 2.4 |

```
S_RES(0) = 0
S_RES(h+1) = S_RES(h) + body_mint_atoms(h+1)
S_RES(h) ≤ 419 430 400 000 000 atoms
```

The cost is **strictly increasing** in height. That is not decoration.
It does two jobs. First, it writes Chapter 1’s duration-proportional
payment as a height function: an earlier mint pays less per RES for a
longer remaining span of protection. Second, it makes the ceiling need
no consensus counter — see the next section.

Whether a mint occurs is demand-driven. The cost **if** it occurs is a
pure function of height, not a market quote, and it does not move with
difficulty.

---

## 2.4 Where the parameters come from

Every issuance parameter is a power of two. That is not decoration. The
cap is the product of three of them, so checking the cap is checking
exponents:

```
RES_MAX_SUPPLY = Σ_{h≥0} S / destroy_cost(h)
               = (S / P0) · H
               = 2⁷ / 2¹⁰ · 2²⁵
               = 2²²
               = 4 194 304 RES
```

`S = 128`, `P0 = 1024`, `H = 2²⁵ = 33 554 432` blocks (about 638 years).
The exponent being exactly 2 is what makes the integral exactly
`(S / P0) · H` with no residual, and therefore what makes the cap land
*on* a power of two rather than near one. Edit any one constant and a
visible identity breaks, rather than a curve quietly shifting.

`RES_DESTROY_SHIFT = 40` is not chosen independently. It is forced by
the genesis destroy cost:

```
R · 1024 · (2²⁵ + h)²  ≤  B · 2⁵⁰
R · (2²⁵ + h)²         ≤  B · 2⁴⁰
```

so `40 = 50 − log₂(1024)`. A different genesis cost moves the shift and
nothing else.

**Why this is an upper bound, and why it needs no consensus
enforcement.** ORU cannot be destroyed before it exists, so destroy
through any height cannot exceed emission through that height.
`destroy_cost` is strictly increasing, so `1 / destroy_cost` is strictly
decreasing. The standard exchange argument says the sum is maximised by
destroying every ORU at the height it appears. That schedule is exactly
the closed-form integral above. Delaying a destroy can only ever yield
less RES. No hoarding strategy reaches the bound from above. Block
validation does not consult a running counter.

Cumulative issuance through any height also has a closed form:

```
cumulative(h) = RES_MAX_SUPPLY · h / (h + 2²⁵)
```

The operational meaning of the pole `h = 2²⁵` is that, at `ρ = 100%`,
the median of the issuance distribution sits at year 638. Cumulative RES
is then half the cap, and destroy cost is about 4 096 ORU per RES.

Realised stock equals participation times the ceiling, exactly:

| ρ | Realised issuance | Utilisation |
|--:|------------------:|------------:|
| 5% | 209 715 RES | 5.0% |
| 20% | 838 861 RES | 20.0% |
| 50% | 2 097 152 RES | 50.0% |
| 100% | 4 194 304 RES | 100.0% |

Minting ends when a whole block’s subsidy no longer buys a single RES
atom. Integer arithmetic decides the height: `118 599 277 598` (about
year 2 254 957). That is a consequence of the parameters, not a
parameter.

---

## 2.5 The schedule is an upper bound, not a calendar promise

The table below is the `ρ = 100%` ceiling. Numbers are printed by the
RFC-020 numeric SSOT. None was computed by hand.

| Year | Height | ORU / RES | Cumulative ORU | Cumulative RES | % of cap |
|-----:|-------:|----------:|---------------:|---------------:|---------:|
| 1 | 52 594 | 1 027.21 | 6 732 032 | 6 564 | 0.16% |
| 4 | 210 379 | 1 036.88 | 26 928 512 | 26 134 | 0.62% |
| 10 | 525 949 | 1 056.35 | 67 321 472 | 64 729 | 1.54% |
| 16 | 841 518 | 1 076.01 | 107 714 304 | 102 616 | 2.45% |
| 32 | 1 683 037 | 1 129.30 | 215 428 736 | 200 331 | 4.78% |
| 50 | 2 629 746 | 1 190.80 | 336 607 488 | 304 828 | 7.27% |
| 100 | 5 259 492 | 1 370.17 | 673 214 976 | 568 350 | 13.55% |
| 250 | 13 148 730 | 1 983.78 | 1 683 037 440 | 1 180 857 | 28.15% |
| 500 | 26 297 460 | 3 258.04 | 3 366 074 880 | 1 842 875 | 43.94% |
| 638 | 33 555 558 | 4 096.14 | 4 295 111 424 | 2 097 187 | 50.00% |
| 1 000 | 52 594 920 | 6 750.01 | 6 732 149 760 | 2 560 659 | 61.05% |
| 2 000 | 105 189 840 | 17 507.75 | 13 464 299 520 | 3 179 938 | 75.82% |

Even at full participation, year 1 issues about 6 564 RES. Thin early
float pins any working secondary ratio to the mint ceiling — the
intended transmission of RES demand into ORU destroy. A market too thin
to discover any ratio cannot start that transmission. The RFC asserts
the mechanism, not the threshold.

Destroy cost changes by about 0.000 089% per block. Wallets construct at
the confirm height plus a flat margin; an over-generous margin is a
rounding error, not a strategy.

Selected pins (atoms, display only):

| Height | Atoms | ORU / 1 RES |
|-------:|------:|------------:|
| 0 | 102 400 000 000 | 1 024 |
| 210 000 | 103 685 749 152 | 1 036.857 491 52 |
| 420 000 | 104 979 520 049 | 1 049.795 200 49 |

## 2.6 The second sink — RFC-018

RFC-020 prices RES **creation**. RFC-018 keeps absorbing ORU when RES
**moves**. The two sinks must not be collapsed into one “supply”
number.

RES transfers still pay network fees on the ORU leg. Half of that fee is
unclaimable in coinbase, never enters the UTXO set, and is therefore
destroyed:

```
destroy_RES_transfer = Σ floor(fee(tx) · 1 / 2)
```

The other half remains claimable, so miners still want to include RES
transfers. Pure ORU spends, Convergence itself, and body mints do not
take this half — Convergence is already destroyed on the `OP_CONVERGE`
path.

Four ORU quantities that must stay separate:

| Quantity | What it is | What it is not |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| ORU ledger supply | Issued subsidy minus Convergence `C(h)` | Circulating UTXO, fee destroy, or a wallet balance |
| Circulating UTXO | Spendable Witness v0 ORU still in the UTXO set | The ledger path, or either destroy |
| Convergence destroy | ORU in an unspendable `OP_CONVERGE` | Fee destroy |
| Fee destroy | Unclaimed half of RES-transfer ORU fees | Convergence `C(h)`, or a destroy UTXO |

Explorers may display each separately. None is a global asset-state
table. Consensus does not keep a “total supply” registry.

---

## 2.7 Where each asset is born

| | **ORU** | **RES** |
|--|---------|---------|
| Job | Hashpower payment, fees, Convergence input | Independent scarce stock |
| Classification | Witness v0 | Witness v1 |
| Ledger origin | Coinbase subsidy `R(h)` | Body-tx destroy-to-mint |
| Per block | 128 ORU (`R(0) = 0`) | Any `R` the predicate admits |
| Who receives it | The miner | The minting transaction’s RES outputs, not the miner |
| Cap | No declared hard cap | Derived `2²²` RES |
| Calendar | Subsidy is a height function | Cost is a height function; occurrence of a mint is not |

**Protocol-enforced:** a mint MUST satisfy the predicate or the
transaction is invalid; `S_RES` MUST NOT exceed the derived ceiling
(runtime defence; §2.4 shows it is unreachable).

**Not guaranteed:** that anyone destroys ORU; that the ceiling is
filled; that a secondary market exists; that `ρ` lands in any band.

---

## 2.8 What this chapter does not claim

- It does not target an external price for either asset.
  `destroy_cost(h)` is not a quote.
- It does not assert that `ρ` will be high, or that the schedule will be
  walked.
- It does not assert that a usable RES/ORU secondary market exists at
  launch.
- It does not collapse the four ORU quantities into one “float” story.
- It does not claim C++ equivalence to the kernel model. The Coq model
  proves selected invariants (including the ORU fold identity
  `n · 128`). It does not prove `ConnectBlock`.

**The rules fix the transform. Whether demand arrives is not a rule.**
Chapter 3 states how the two identities exist on the ledger as native
UTXO scripts — not as a registry, and not as an overlay.
