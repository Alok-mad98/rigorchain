# RIGOR Consensus Invariants

**Status:** Consensus rule extraction from production implementation.

**Purpose:**  
This document identifies the consensus properties that define the RIGOR Mainnet protocol boundary.

This document introduces:

- no new consensus rule;
- no activation mechanism;
- no governance procedure;
- no upgrade process.

It is a description of rules already enforced by the production consensus implementation.

If this document and the implementation disagree:

> The implementation defines the protocol behavior.  
> This document is a human-readable extraction of that behavior.

---

## 1. Protocol Permanence Principle

RIGOR is designed as a fixed monetary protocol.

After mainnet activation, the network does not contain any consensus mechanism that can modify:

- monetary issuance rules;
- asset identity rules;
- transaction validity rules;
- Proof-of-Work identity;
- ledger model;
- genesis identity.

There is:

- no governance layer;
- no voting mechanism;
- no version-bit monetary upgrade path;
- no emergency consensus override.

A change to a consensus invariant is not a RIGOR software upgrade.

It is a different protocol.

A network running modified consensus rules is a separate blockchain with separate monetary properties.

---

## 2. Consensus Boundary

The RIGOR protocol boundary is defined by four invariant categories.

```
Monetary Invariants
        +
Ledger Invariants
        +
Execution Invariants
        +
Network Identity Invariants
```

Together they define the meaning of the chain.

---

## 3. Monetary Invariants

Monetary rules define what assets exist, how they enter circulation, and how scarcity is enforced.

These rules are consensus-critical.

### 3.1 ORU Issuance

ORU is created only through valid Proof-of-Work subsidy.

Consensus rule:

```
subsidy(h) = 0          if h <= 0
subsidy(h) = 128 ORU    if h >= 1
```

`128 ORU` is `ORU_FLAT_BLOCK_SUBSIDY` = `128 * COIN` = `12800000000` atoms. `COIN` is `100000000`. Height 0 uses `ORU_GENESIS_BLOCK_SUBSIDY` = `0`. `GetBlockSubsidy` ignores chain parameters. `RES_REWARD_EPOCH` (`210000`) is an observational calendar. It does not cut the subsidy.

Properties:

- no halving;
- no administrative issuance;
- no founder allocation;
- no treasury issuance.

The miner subsidy is independent of:

- transaction volume;
- RES creation;
- holder behavior.

A coinbase may also collect ORU fees already present in the UTXO set. That collection is not new issuance. The claimable coinbase ORU is bounded by:

```
claimable = (ORU fees − RES-transfer fee burn) + subsidy(h)
```

The RES-transfer fee burn is `floor(fee / 2)`. `RigorSupplyDelta` rejects a larger coinbase with `bad-cb-amount`. Fees, the burn, and the subsidy are the whole coinbase ORU budget.

The subsidy rule is enforced by consensus validation.

Changing:

```
128 ORU/block
```

creates a different monetary protocol.

### 3.2 RES Supply Boundary

RES has a protocol-defined maximum supply:

```
RES_MAX_SUPPLY = 2^22 RES
               = 4,194,304 RES
               = 419,430,400,000,000 atoms
```

This value is derived from the issuance function:

```
S  = 128 ORU
P0 = 1024 ORU

RES_MAX_SUPPLY = (S / P0) × 2^25
               = 2^22 RES
```

`P0` is `RES_DESTROY_COST_GENESIS`: the ORU destroyed to mint one whole RES at height 0. The pole `2^25` is `RES_DESTROY_POLE`. The consensus mint check does not use a displayed price. It evaluates:

```
R = 0  →  a plain ORU destroy is allowed
R > 0  →  R · (2^25 + h)^2  ≤  B << 40
```

`R` is RES atoms created by the transaction. `B` is ORU atoms destroyed by that transaction's Convergence output. `40` is `RES_DESTROY_SHIFT`, forced by `P0 = 1024 ORU`. A single mint with `R` above `RES_MAX_SUPPLY` is rejected.

RES cannot be:

- mined;
- created by coinbase;
- issued by an administrator;
- created outside the convergence rule.

`GetBlockSubsidy` returns ORU only. Mainnet coinbase RES must be 0 (`bad-cb-res-amount`). A body transaction creates RES only by destroying ORU in the same transaction. The predicate is a pure function of `(R, B, h)`. No key is a mint authority.

The supply boundary is enforced by consensus.

Changing:

```
RES_MAX_SUPPLY
```

creates a different monetary protocol.

### 3.3 Asset Direction Invariant

RIGOR defines a one-way monetary transformation:

```
ORU → RES
```

A valid transition exists:

```
destroy ORU
    |
    v
create RES
```

The reverse transition does not exist:

```
RES → ORU
```

No consensus rule allows:

- RES redemption;
- RES conversion;
- administrative conversion.

An ORU output funded without ORU inputs is rejected (`illegal-res-to-oru-conversion`). RES may be spent to RES. The network fee on that spend is still ORU. RES amounts never pay the fee.

Changing this direction changes the meaning of the two-asset architecture.

---

## 4. Ledger Invariants

RIGOR uses a single UTXO state model.

Consensus recognizes:

```
one chain
one UTXO set
one validation engine
two native asset identities
```

The protocol does not contain:

- account balances;
- contract storage;
- external asset registry;
- parallel asset ledger.

Asset identity is derived from:

```
scriptPubKey
    +
consensus classification
```

Classification is `AssetTypeFromScriptPubKey`. There is no `(asset, amount, script)` consensus field.

It does not come from:

- wallet software;
- explorer databases;
- external metadata.

`AddCoins` inserts an output only when it is neither Convergence nor `OP_RETURN`. Convergence value leaves circulation because the output is never stored. Spending a missing or already-spent outpoint fails closed. Wallet balances and observational supply ledgers are views. They are not a second ledger.

Changing the ledger model creates a different protocol.

---

## 5. Execution Invariants

Execution rules define how transactions are authorized and how outputs are classified.

### 5.1 Script Templates

RIGOR accepts only the defined consensus templates:

| Template | Asset | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Witness v0 / 20 bytes | ORU | spendable ORU |
| Witness v1 / 32 bytes Ed25519 | RES | spendable RES |
| HASH160 + `0xbd` | ORU destroy | Convergence |
| zero-value `OP_RETURN` | data | non-asset data |

Witness v0 is ORU only at program length 20. Witness version is `0x00`. Witness v1 is RES only at program length 32, witness version `0x51`, and only when the program does not begin with the retired prefixes `CVG2` or `RES2`. The 32-byte program is the Ed25519 public key.

Convergence is the 22-byte script `PUSHBYTES_20 || 20-byte HASH160 || 0xbd`. `0xbd` means this ORU output is destroyed. Opcode meaning is consensus meaning. Changing `OP_CONVERGE` semantics changes the monetary protocol.

`OP_RETURN` is byte `0x6a` followed by pushes. Its value must be 0. A non-zero value is not a burn and not a third asset.

The protocol does not contain:

- Script VM;
- arbitrary opcode execution;
- smart contracts.

Legacy opcode numbers, including `0xac` (`CHECKSIG`), are inert. They do not authorize a spend. Bare P2PKH, P2SH, P2WSH, and Taproot are not consensus templates.

Changing accepted templates changes the transaction language of RIGOR.

### 5.2 Signature Rules

RIGOR transaction authorization uses:

```
Ed25519
```

Consensus parameters:

```
Public key:   32 bytes
Signature:    64 bytes
Sighash:      RIGOR domain-separated signing
```

The signature is a raw detached Ed25519 signature. There is no hashtype byte. ORU spends commit under the domain `RGRORU01`. RES spends commit under `RGRRES01`. The sighash covers the domain tag, the chain id (the genesis hash), and the whole transaction.

The authorization path is fixed by:

```
VerifyRigorPredicate
```

`ConnectBlock` reaches that function through `CheckInputScripts`. A witness program without witness verification fails closed. It is not anyone-can-spend. RES has one key path. ECDSA and secp256k1 are not authorization rules.

Changing:

- signature algorithm;
- key format;
- signing domain;
- witness authorization rules;

changes which transactions are valid.

Therefore it changes the protocol.

### 5.3 Proof-of-Work Identity

RIGOR separates:

```
block identity
```

from

```
Proof-of-Work validity
```

Block identity:

```
SHA256d(header_80)
```

Proof-of-Work:

```
SHA3-256("RGRPOW01" || header_80)
```

The header is 80 bytes: version, previous block, merkle root, time, `nBits`, nonce. The domain prefix is 8 bytes. The preimage is 88 bytes. A header is valid when its block id is the genesis hash, or when the SHA3-256 digest is at or below the `nBits` target. SHA3-256 of the header without `RGRPOW01` is not a proof.

Consensus-critical properties include:

- 80-byte header layout;
- `RGRPOW01` domain separation;
- SHA3-256 PoW;
- target calculation;
- ASERT parameters.

Mainnet target spacing is 600 seconds. The ASERT half-life is 43200 seconds, anchored at height 1, with a per-block clamp of ±12.5%. Mainnet genesis `nBits` is `0x1d008000`.

Changing Proof-of-Work creates a different chain.

---

## 6. Network Identity Invariants

Genesis defines chain identity.

Mainnet identity:

```
Genesis hash:

e2ce92cfef740f92e8cc84a8541d8e760c776c668afd9b61740b3a4315241468

Genesis activation:

2026-10-25 06:00:00 UTC
```

That instant is `nTime = 1792908000`. The same header also locks:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Merkle root | `9d3fbd207af927fc8e2c57e975d8d5845913bf059d956592e8a0bcf38b3515dd` |
| `nBits` | `0x1d008000` |
| `nNonce` | `0` |
| `nVersion` | `1` |
| Coinbase value | `0` |
| Coinbase message | `Selection not computation. Convergence defines state. Naming is consensus.` |

Genesis parameters are not configuration data.

They identify the network.

A different genesis identity represents a different blockchain.

## 7. Consensus Change Classification

### Consensus-preserving changes

These do not modify which blocks or transactions are valid:

- explorer improvements;
- wallet interface improvements;
- RPC additions;
- monitoring tools;
- documentation updates.

### Protocol-breaking changes

The following create a different protocol.

**Monetary**

- changing ORU issuance;
- adding halving;
- changing RES supply;
- changing convergence rules;
- adding administrative issuance.

**Asset model**

- adding new asset classes;
- changing the ORU/RES relationship;
- adding reverse conversion.

**Transaction model**

- adding new script templates;
- changing opcode meaning;
- replacing Ed25519 authorization.

**Chain security**

- changing the PoW algorithm;
- changing header structure;
- changing difficulty rules.

**Identity**

- changing genesis parameters.

A protocol-breaking change is not a RIGOR upgrade. It creates a separate network.

---

## 8. No Consensus Upgrade Mechanism

RIGOR intentionally does not include a mechanism that changes these invariants.

There is:

- no on-chain governance;
- no consensus voting;
- no version-bit monetary activation;
- no emergency override.

The only compiled version-bits deployment is `DEPLOYMENT_TESTDUMMY`, and on mainnet its start time is `NEVER_ACTIVE`. It does not retarget issuance, assets, scripts, signatures, or proof-of-work.

A future system may choose different rules.

However:

A system with different consensus invariants is not an upgraded RIGOR Mainnet.

It is a separate protocol.

---

## 9. Verification Philosophy

The purpose of these invariants is not to create trust in a development team.

The purpose is to define what independent participants can verify.

A user does not need to trust:

- a website;
- an explorer;
- a developer statement.

A full node evaluates:

- issuance;
- asset classification;
- transaction validity;
- Proof-of-Work;
- state transition rules.

The protocol boundary exists in consensus code.

[`core/src/test/consensus_invariants_tests.cpp`](../../core/src/test/consensus_invariants_tests.cpp) pins the constants and the validation paths named in this document. A change to those rules fails that suite. The suite does not add a rule. It records the rules the node already enforces.

### How to run the suite

From the repository root:

```bash
core/src/test/test_rigor --run_test=consensus_invariants_tests
```

A passing run prints `Running 14 test cases...` and ends with `*** No errors detected`.

The 14 cases are one suite. Section 10 lists fewer rows because that table names enforcement files, and several cases call the same file. The directories `core/src/consensus/`, `core/src/kernel/`, and `core/src/script/` are where those files live.

| Test | Rule it pins | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `oru_subsidy_is_flat_and_has_no_halving` | Height 0 pays 0. Every height ≥ 1 pays 128 ORU. Height 210000 does not halve. | [`rigor_issuance.cpp`](../../core/src/consensus/rigor_issuance.cpp) |
| `coinbase_cannot_mint_oru_or_res` | A coinbase cannot claim ORU beyond the subsidy bound. Mainnet coinbase cannot carry RES. | [`rigor_supply.cpp`](../../core/src/consensus/rigor_supply.cpp) |
| `res_max_supply_and_destroy_cost_are_closed_form` | `RES_MAX_SUPPLY = 2^22` RES, genesis destroy cost 1024 ORU, pole `2^25`, shift 40. | [`res_issuance.h`](../../core/src/consensus/res_issuance.h) |
| `res_mint_predicate_rejects_underpay_and_free_mint` | One atom short mints nothing. A zero burn cannot mint. One mint cannot exceed the cap. | [`res_issuance.h`](../../core/src/consensus/res_issuance.h) |
| `body_mint_requires_converged_oru` | A body transaction mints RES only by destroying enough ORU through `OP_CONVERGE`. | [`tx_verify.cpp`](../../core/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp) |
| `res_cannot_convert_to_oru` | RES inputs alone cannot create ORU (`illegal-res-to-oru-conversion`). | [`tx_verify.cpp`](../../core/src/consensus/tx_verify.cpp) |
| `script_templates_are_closed` | The four templates classify to their assets. P2WSH, P2PKH, `CVG2`, and `RES2` are rejected. | [`rigor_classify.cpp`](../../core/src/script/rigor_classify.cpp) |
| `only_listed_templates_pass_checktransaction` | `CheckTransaction` accepts those templates. `OP_RETURN` value must be 0. | [`tx_check.cpp`](../../core/src/consensus/tx_check.cpp) |
| `opcode_bytes_keep_consensus_meaning` | `0x6a`, `0xbd`, and `0xbb` are asset markers. `0xbc` is burned. `0xac` is inert and is not `CHECKSIG`. | [`rigor_bytes.h`](../../core/src/script/rigor_bytes.h), [`rigor_opcode_namespace.cpp`](../../core/src/script/rigor_opcode_namespace.cpp) |
| `authorization_is_ed25519_only` | Public key is 32 bytes. Signature is 64 bytes. Domains are `RGRORU01` and `RGRRES01`. A 33-byte secp public key is rejected. | [`predicate_verify.cpp`](../../core/src/script/predicate_verify.cpp) |
| `ledger_is_utxo_admission` | ORU and RES enter the UTXO set. Convergence and `OP_RETURN` do not. | [`coins.cpp`](../../core/src/coins.cpp) |
| `pow_is_sha3_rgrpow01` | Domain `RGRPOW01`, 80-byte header, SHA3-256 digest, and `CheckProofOfWork`. | [`pow_digest.cpp`](../../core/src/rigor_kernel/pow_digest.cpp), [`pow.cpp`](../../core/src/pow.cpp) |
| `mainnet_genesis_identity` | Mainnet genesis hash, merkle root, time, `nBits`, and nonce. | [`chainparams.cpp`](../../core/src/kernel/chainparams.cpp) |
| `no_versionbits_activation` | The only version-bits deployment is `TESTDUMMY`, and it is `NEVER_ACTIVE`. | [`chainparams.cpp`](../../core/src/kernel/chainparams.cpp) |

## 10. Source Authority

Consensus enforcement locations:

```
core/src/consensus/
core/src/kernel/
core/src/script/
core/src/validation.cpp
core/src/coins.cpp
```

| Component | Function |
|---|---|
| `rigor_issuance.cpp` | ORU issuance |
| `res_issuance.h` | RES supply rules |
| `rigor_supply.cpp` | Coinbase ORU bound and the rejection of coinbase RES |
| `tx_verify.cpp` | RES creation rules and the rejection of RES → ORU |
| `tx_check.cpp` | Accepted output templates |
| `rigor_classify.cpp` | Asset classification |
| `predicate_verify.cpp` | Authorization (`VerifyRigorPredicate`) |
| `pow_digest.cpp` | Proof-of-Work digest |
| `pow.cpp` | Proof-of-Work check |
| `chainparams.cpp` | Genesis identity |
| `coins.cpp` | UTXO admission |

Wallet, RPC, and explorer code may refuse a transaction that consensus would also refuse. They do not define these invariants.

---

## Final Statement

RIGOR does not define value through promises.

It defines a protocol boundary through deterministic rules.

The purpose of consensus invariants is:

```
to make monetary rules inspectable
to make asset rules deterministic
to make protocol boundaries explicit
```

A participant may evaluate the design.

A developer may improve software around it.

But changing the consensus boundary means creating a different protocol.

RIGOR Mainnet remains defined by the rules that every node independently verifies.
