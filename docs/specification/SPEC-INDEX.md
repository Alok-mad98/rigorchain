# RIGOR Specification Index

**Track:** Formal Specification Program  
**Document status:** Production specification  
**Purpose:** Canonical index of the specification layer. All future formal models and
proofs MUST reference documents listed here.

> **Parameter boundary.** Live issuance is RFC-020 (`docs/protocol/RFC-020.md`).
> RFC-014 / RFC-015 / RFC-019 numbers are historical and not active consensus
> parameters. Historical RFC texts: `archive/rfc/`.

## Authority

The specification layer defines what RIGOR **SHOULD** do. It does not define what
any implementation currently does. Implementation is evidence for alignment, not a
source of normative semantics.

**Hierarchy:**

```
Specification  →  Formal Model  →  Proof  →  Runtime Alignment Evidence
```

**Specification supersedes implementation** (see `SPEC-000` §7 and
[`../formal/SSOT_HIERARCHY.md`](../formal/SSOT_HIERARCHY.md)).

**Freeze boundary:** Nothing in this index or its documents supersedes
`MAINNET_PROTOCOL_FREEZE_DECLARATION.md`.

## Historical design notes

SPEC-008 records the live Proof-of-Work digest. Production `core/src/pow.cpp`
implements it. The retired 64 KiB mix in `pow_opus.cpp` is not the live
work function.

---

## Planned Documents (Placeholders)

All planned specification-layer documents through SPEC-007 are **ESTABLISHED**.
SPEC-008 is **implemented** in production `CheckProofOfWork`.

| ID | Title | Status | Scope (planned) |
