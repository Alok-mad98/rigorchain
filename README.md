# RIGOR

A Proof-of-Work UTXO Architecture for Two Native Monetary Roles

Display version is `RIGOR_RELEASE_VERSION` in `core/src/clientversion.h`.

RIGOR is a Bitcoin-inspired UTXO blockchain protocol exploring a
different approach to native monetary design.

The protocol separates two monetary roles at the consensus layer:

- **ORU** — the transaction and security asset
- **RES** — a separately defined scarce asset created through
  deterministic Convergence

Both are native ledger objects verified by the same full-node consensus
rules.

RIGOR does not introduce an account model, smart-contract execution
layer, or external asset registry.

Its design focuses on a narrower question:

> Can different monetary functions be separated while preserving the
> verification properties of a Bitcoin-style UTXO system?

---

## Design Principles

RIGOR is built around several constraints:

- Single UTXO state space
- Script-defined asset identity
- Proof-of-Work chain ordering
- Deterministic monetary transformation
- Minimal consensus surface

Asset identity is determined by consensus-defined `scriptPubKey`
classification.

It is not maintained by a registry, explorer interpretation, or wallet
metadata.

The node decides validity.

Products display public data.

---

## Verification Boundary

RIGOR distinguishes:

```
Protocol model
≠
Running C++ implementation
≠
Product interfaces
```

Formal verification covers properties of the protocol model.

It does not claim C++ equivalence, compiler correctness, network
guarantees, or economic outcomes.

```
equivalence_claimed = false
cpp_formal_equivalence = false
documentation_consensus_authority = false
```

---

## Protocol Verification Status

Protocol specifications are normative SSOT.
Implementations realize the frozen protocol.

Philosophy:

- [RIGOR Principles](docs/philosophy/RIGOR_PRINCIPLES.md)
- [Protocol Boundary](docs/philosophy/RIGOR_PROTOCOL_BOUNDARY.md)

Protocol:

- [Consensus Invariants](docs/protocol/RIGOR_CONSENSUS_INVARIANTS.md)

Security:

- [Security Patch Boundary](docs/security/RIGOR_SECURITY_PATCH_BOUNDARY.md)

After mainnet activation, consensus invariants fix the protocol
boundary: monetary issuance, asset separation, script templates,
transaction authorization, proof-of-work identity, and ledger
transition.

Changing these rules is not a software upgrade. It defines a different
protocol and a separate network.

---

## Treasury & Market Neutrality

RIGOR is designed to be a protocol and network, not a price-support operation.

From Mainnet Genesis, the RIGOR project adopts a public Treasury & Market Neutrality Policy governing the use of project-controlled resources and the project's conduct toward the ORU and RES markets.

The project may actively:

* develop and maintain the protocol;
* operate public infrastructure;
* improve network security;
* support independent miners and developers;
* fund security audits and research;
* develop wallets, mining software and tooling;
* support legitimate ecosystem and exchange integrations.

The project does **not** make maintaining or increasing the market price of ORU or RES an operational objective.

The project will not knowingly coordinate:

* artificial market demand;
* pump-and-dump activity;
* wash trading;
* artificial trading volume;
* price support or price floors;
* misleading market signals;
* preferential non-public information for trading purposes.

Independent participants remain free to buy, hold, sell, mine, develop, provide liquidity for, or otherwise participate in the RIGOR ecosystem.

The market determines the economic value of RIGOR.

The project's responsibility is to build a network worthy of independent participation.

> **Build the protocol. Build the infrastructure. Do not control the market.**

## 1. What is RIGOR

RIGOR is a dual-asset UTXO protocol. ORU is the utility asset. RES may be
minted only by destroying ORU at `destroy_cost(h)` when
consensus-defined issuance conditions hold. Asset class is inferred from
`scriptPubKey`. There is no account model and no administrative key on
the consensus path.

## 2. Protocol identity

AlphaPlus / Alpha1 names are historical release channels, not the current

## 3. Consensus overview

```
RIGOR =
    Dual Native Assets
  + UTXO Monetary Model
  + Consensus-defined Issuance Conditions
  + Deflationary Fee Burn
  + Probabilistic Convergence Selection
  + Adaptive Proof-of-Work (ASERT)
  + Cryptographic Ownership (Ed25519)
```

Consensus state is the UTXO set plus validation rules. Rebuildable indexes
are not monetary truth.

- Ordinary transfers cannot mint.
- ORU coinbase subsidy and coinbase RES mint are explicit exceptions.
- `ConnectBlock` is the admission path. Explorer display is observation.

There is **no Bitcoin Script VM**. Spends are structured predicates
(`VerifyRigorPredicate`). Live markers: RETURN `0x6a`, RES mint
`0xbb`, CONVERGE `0xbd`.

## 4. Native assets

| Asset | Role |
|-------|------|
| **ORU** | Transaction asset, fee asset, mining subsidy, Convergence burn |
| **RES** | Reserve asset. Issued only when consensus-defined issuance conditions hold after Convergence. **Not a PoW reward.** |

PoW does not create RES.

ORU: 8 decimals (`COIN = 1e8`). Genesis subsidy is **0**. Height ≥ 1
pays **128 ORU** forever. No ORU cap.

RES: 8 decimals (`RES_COIN = 1e8`). Cap `RES_MAX_SUPPLY =
419430400000000` atoms (`2²²` RES). Minted only in a body transaction
that burns ORU (`OP_CONVERGE`) and creates Witness v1 RES in the same
transaction when `R · (2²⁵+h)² ≤ B << 40`. `2⁴⁰` is the integer
consensus scaling factor. Display form
`destroy_cost(h) = 1024 · (2²⁵+h)² / 2⁵⁰` uses `2⁵⁰` as the curve
normalization denominator; that denominator is not a consensus shift.
Display rounding/floor do not enter consensus.

RFC-018: half of the ORU fee on a RES-transfer is unclaimable. That burn
is not a UTXO and not a wallet balance.

---

## 5. Mining

**Node consensus PoW** is SHA3-256 over a domain-tagged header:

```
digest = SHA3-256("RGRPOW01" || header_80)
```

Difficulty is ASERT (aserti3-2d), mainnet half-life **12 hours** (43200 s),
anchor height 1, ±12.5% per-block clamp. Target spacing 10 minutes.

SOLO path: `getblocktemplate` → copy canonical coinbase bytes → nonce
search → `submitblock`. The node builds ORU subsidy and scriptSig.
RES mint is a body transaction, not a coinbase prize. Stratum is not a
SOLO URL.

The repository includes a reference miner implementation (`minerd`) that
searches SHA3-256 `"RGRPOW01" || header_80`, matching node
`CheckProofOfWork`.

SOLO mining uses a miner-owned local RIGOR node and does not require a
publicly reachable mining RPC endpoint.
[`docs/mining/SOLO_MINING.md`](docs/mining/SOLO_MINING.md).

miners and operators: [`docs/mining/MINING_SCOPE.md`](docs/mining/MINING_SCOPE.md).

[`miner/README_MINER.md`](miner/README_MINER.md).

---

## 6. Wallet

`rigor-qt` / `rigor-wallet` / `rigor-cli`. Dual-asset UTXO wallet
supporting ORU and RES outputs. Backup/restore with `backupwallet` /
`restorewallet`.

The wallet constructs transactions. Consensus decides Convergence
outcomes and RES mints. The wallet does not mine.

Guide: [`docs/user/Wallet.md`](docs/user/Wallet.md).

---

## 7. Explorer

Independent observation product. Not consensus. Not a ledger of record.

Display identity matches the node: genesis
`e2ce92cf…1468`, HRP `rg`, RPC `8761`.

[`docs/explorer/EXPLORER_ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/explorer/EXPLORER_ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## 8. Security model

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| UTXO conservation | Ordinary transfers cannot create ORU or RES |
| Script validation | Restricted monetary script families; classification ≠ issuance |
| Proof-of-Work | OpuHash = SHA3-256 (`RGRPOW01`) with ASERT difficulty |
| Ed25519 | Cryptographic ownership of spendable outputs |
| Formal protocol properties | Model invariants — see section 9 |

Vulnerability reporting: [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). Do not expose
JSON-RPC to the public Internet.

Security boundary: [`docs/security/RIGOR_SECURITY_PATCH_BOUNDARY.md`](docs/security/RIGOR_SECURITY_PATCH_BOUNDARY.md).

---

## 9. Verification model

```
equivalence_claimed = false
hash_kernel_shared_binary_with_cpp = false
refinement_proved = false
```

Formal verification proves properties of the protocol model. It does not
prove that the C++ implementation is a refinement of that model.
